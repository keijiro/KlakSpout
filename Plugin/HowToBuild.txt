How to build the DLL
--------------------

For personal preference, I use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to build the
plugin DLL binary. You can use Visual Studio instead, but you have to create a
solution by yourself for that case.

To build the DLL on the WSL environment, you have to install the MinGW cross
compiler (mingw-w64).

> sudo apt install mingw-w64

Then, use Makefile to build the DLL file.
